# Social-Context

This is a sophisticated AD4M Language for link sharing (LinkLanguage) in Shared Perspectives, built using Holochain.

## Build
```
npm i
npm run build
```
This builds the Holochain DNA first, using `nix-shell` (which needs to be installed) and then packages the whole language including the DNA in `build/bundle.js`.
