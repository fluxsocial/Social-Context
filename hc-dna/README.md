# Public-Social-Content

Holochain DNA that implements the Social-Context [trait](https://github.com/juntofoundation/Holochain-Trait-Definitions#social-context) for collective based entry sharing a DNA discovery. 
This Repo contains two implementation of the Social-Context trait. A private implementation and a public one. The private implementation also includes a social_graph zome. This zome is developed in accordance with the Social-Graph [trait](https://github.com/juntofoundation/Holochain-Trait-Definitions#social-graph). 

There is no validation on commited GlobalEntryRef's to check if target dna address & entry address are valid. More work to be done in this department.
